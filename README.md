# Concrete Strenght Predictor: Artificial Neural Network Powered Web-App with Docker Deployment

Fully functional website was developed using HTML, integrated with a FastAPI backend, to predict the compressive strength of concrete. The prediction model runs on an artificial neural network (ANN) and was deployed with Docker to make it easy to run anywhere, no matter the platform.

## Video Demonstration of the App on YouTube (In case the link above does not work)

To give you a quick overview of how the app works, Iâ€™ve created a demonstration video.
