# Concrete Strenght Predictor: Artificial Neural Network Powered Web-App with Docker Deployment

In this project, a fully functional website was developed using HTML, integrated with a FastAPI backend, to predict the compressive strength of concrete. The prediction model is powered by artificial neural networks (ANN) and was deployed using Docker for seamless containerization and cross-platform compatibility.

## Video Demonstration of the App on YouTube (In case the link above does not work)

To give you a quick overview of how the app works, Iâ€™ve created a demonstration video.
